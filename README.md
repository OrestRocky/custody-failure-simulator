# Custody Failure Simulator

This project simulates failure scenarios in private digital custody systems.

It does NOT store secrets.
It models how control over a secret degrades or collapses over time.

Focus:
- leakage vs loss
- human discontinuity
- recovery assumptions
- irreversible failure modes

This is not a security tool.
It is a conceptual and analytical simulator.
